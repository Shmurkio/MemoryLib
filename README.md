# MemoryLib

Library that ports functions for dynamic memory management to EDK2 (C++).

## Functions

`calloc`, `malloc`, `free`, `new` and `delete`. This is enough for basic memory management. More `new` and `delete` overloads can be added if needed (check _MemoryLib.hpp_).

## How to use the library

Put the _MemoryLib.hpp_ in the _\MdePkg\Include\Library_ folder and the _MemoryLib_ folder in the _\MdePkg\Library_ folder.
